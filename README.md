This repository demonstrates **feature map visualization** in deep learning using the **VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The project focuses on understanding how convolutional layers process an input image step by step, transforming raw pixels into hierarchical feature representations.

## 🔍 Project Overview
CNNs like VGG16 extract visual features progressively. Early layers capture **edges and simple textures**, while deeper layers detect **shapes, patterns, and object parts**. By visualizing intermediate feature maps, we can gain insights into how the network learns representations that are later used for classification tasks.

In this project, an image is passed through the **pre-trained VGG16 model** (from Keras/TensorFlow), and the outputs of convolutional layers are extracted. These outputs, also called **activation maps**, are displayed and saved for each layer. This makes it easier to interpret what the network “sees” at different depths.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Pre-trained VGG16** model is used for transfer learning and visualization.  
- Processes an input image through all convolutional layers.  
- Generates and displays **feature maps** at multiple depths.  
- Provides a clear picture of **hierarchical feature extraction** in CNNs.  
- Lightweight code that can be adapted for other CNN architectures.  

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understand how CNNs transform low-level features (edges, colors, textures) into high-level concepts (object parts, semantic features).  
- Explore **layer-wise activations** in VGG16.  
- Gain hands-on experience in **visual interpretability of deep learning models**.  

## 🚀 Applications
- Useful for **educational purposes** to explain CNN internals.  
- Helps in **model interpretability and explainability**.  
- Can be extended to compare activations across different models (ResNet, Inception, etc.).  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**
